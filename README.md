# Advanced CSS Challenge
<br />
<br />
A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.<br />

<br />
With these points in mind, in this Challenge you'll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It's a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!<br />
<br />
note
If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course. However, at least one application should be live. So you can add on Challenge 1's deployed application or Module's 1 Mini Project's deployed application.<br />
<br />
Let's take a look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember from your first Challenge, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.<br />
<br />

## User Story
<br />
<br />

```
AS AN employer 
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
<br />
<br />

### Acceptance Criteria
<br />
<br />
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs: <br />
<br />
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
<br />
<br />

### Grading Requirements
<br />
<br />

**Semantic Elements 70%**
<br />
The HTML file must have:<br />
*a header element - 10 points<br />
*a title element - 10 points<br />
*a meta element for the viewport - 10 points<br />
*a linked stylesheet - 10 points<br />
*a nav element - 10 points<br />
*more than one section element - 10 points<br />
<br />

**Portfolio Background Images 10%**
<br />
Five portfolio images added as background images - 2 points each<br />
<br />

**Navigation Links 10%**
<br />
A navigation link for each section - 10 points<br />
<br />

**CSS is Responsive 10%**
<br />
You'll need to update the CSS so that it contains media queries to make the page responsive. Currently, the first portfolio column is set to have a greater height than the others when the page width is greater than 768px. When the page width is less than 768px, the portfolio columns should stack and be the same height.
